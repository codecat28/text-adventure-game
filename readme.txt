This rpg text adventure was made by following along with a 
youtuber called Vincent Gizzarelli.

The story content of the text game and some parts of the code are 
my original code.  

The story is as follows:

A young adventurer recieves a prophecy that the demon king will take over
the world in that same day. It is up to the adventurer to save the kingdom
with other adventurers they meet along the way.
